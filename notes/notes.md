## 003 - Instructions Per Clock

- Terms:
  - IPC: Instructions per clock
  - ILP: Instruction level parallelism

## 004 - Monday Q&A #1 (2023-02-05)

- Sunk cost: often a tool/programming language used is based on familiarity/invested time or resources and not because it is the "best". Even in new companies/new projects people will often use what they know.

- Parallelism in CPU: assembly instructions get internally split up into multiple micro operations (micro-ops), there are tools that simulate a cpu and can tell you what the bottleneck is
